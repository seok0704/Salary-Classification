# Salary Classification of Data Scientisst

The major goal of this assignment is to gain insights into career paths that could get you a high salary in the field of data science. We will be using the "2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey" data to perform supervised machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) to make a prediction on which salary bracket a person belongs to depending on the answers they have provided in the survey.

Dataset Used is: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018

As part of the analysis, the following steps were taken:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Explanatory Data Analysis
3. Feature selection
4. Model implementation
5. Model tuning
6. Testing & Discussion
